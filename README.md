# dF RP² Mail/PasswordSniffer

This script is a man-in-the-middle attack against your own RP²-installation.
It allows to sniff all entered email passwords and store them into a database and send mail notifications.

IMPORTANT: Don't use this script, dF doesn't recommend to use this script.
Don't use this script if not everybody is informed about storing passwords as plain text.
Don't install this script if you don't know exactly what you're doing.

Thanks.
